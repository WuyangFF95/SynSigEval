\title{Assess/evaluate multiple summarized runs from a software package.}
\usage{
SummarizeMultiRuns(tool.dir, run.names, overwrite)
}
\arguments{
\item{tool.dir}{Fourth level path from the \code{top.dir}. Expected to have
multiple runs with different names (e.g. "seed.1")
That is,
\code{top.dir}/sp.sp/ExtrAttr/sa.results/. or
\code{top.dir}/sa.sa.96/Attr/deconstructSigs.results/

Here, \code{top.dir} refers to a top-level directory which contains the
full information of a synthetic dataset. (e.g. \code{syn.2.7a.7b.abst.v8})
This code depends on a conventional directory structure documented
elsewhere. However there should be a directory within the \code{tool.dir}
which stores the software output.}

\item{run.names}{A character vector records the list of \code{run.dir},
or fifth level directories from the dataset top-level folder.
E.g., c("seed.1","seed.691")}

\item{overwrite}{If TRUE overwrite existing directories and files.}
}
\value{
A list contain c(\code{mean},\code{sd}) of multiple runs:
Cosine similarity
True Positives(TP): Ground-truth signatures which are active in
the spectra, and extracted.
False Negatives(FN): Ground-truth signatures not extracted.
False Positives(FP): Signatures wrongly extracted, not resembling
any ground-truth signatures.
True Positive Rate (TPR, Sensitivity): TP / (TP + FN)
False Discovery Rate (FDR): FP / (FP + TP)
