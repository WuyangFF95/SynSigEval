## SynSigEval

Evaluate Results of Computational Approaches on Synthetic Datasets by 
generated by package `SynSigGen`. 


## NEWS
### SinSigEval 0.1.8
#### Last version evaluates the results on SBS1-SBS5-only dataset, using the functions listed below:


This require the synthetic tumor datasets and the results of computational apporaches in a 5-layer folder structure:

Level 1: Datasets (e.g. `S.0.1.Rsq.0.1`);  
Layer 2: Folder `sp.sp`:  

* Meaning of 1st "sp": synthetic tumors were generated using signature profiles extracted by SigProfiler in [Alexandrov et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1943-3). The signature profiles are available [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn12025148).
* Meaning of 2nd "sp": according to [Alexandrov et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3441), many tumor types have a mean SBS1 exposure of ~300, inferred by SigProfiler. Therefore, we chose the `log10(exposure of SBS1)` in 20 synthetic datasets to be `2.5`.

Level 3: De-novo extraction (`ExtrAttr`), or extraction with ground-truth signatures known (`ExtrAttrExact`);  
Level 4: Results of computational approaches (e.g. `hdp.results`);  
Level 5: Results of runs with seeds (e.g. `seed.1`, `run.1`).  

Notes for 5-layer folder structure:

*   The synthetic tumor spectra should be generated by `CreateSBS1SBS5CorrelatedSyntheticData()` in `SynSigGen = 1.0.4`, and 
*   We recommend generate the results of computational approaches using `data-raw/scripts.for.SBS1SBS5` in `SynSigRun = 0.0.5`.


### SinSigEval 0.1.2
Updated package documentation and `README`. 

### SinSigEval 0.1.1
#### Removed
* MatchSigsAndRelabel.R (functionality was moved to `ICAMSxtra`) and
  adjusted the code in this package accordingly

### SynSigEval 0.0.4.90xx
#### Added
* Created [README.md](https://github.com/WuyangFF95/SynSigEval/blob/master/README.md) and reference manual.
